- [**Customer Subscription Prediction**](customer_subscription_prediction)

>In this Case Study, we will be working for a fin-tech company that wants to provide its customers with a paid mobile app subscription that will allow them to track all of their finances in one place. Here, we will Predict customers who are going to subscribe the premium feature of the mobile application based on data of customer enrollment & usage of the Free Trial of mobile application premium feature.

- [**Breast Cancer Detection**](breast_cancer_detection)

>Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. Accurately identifying and categorizing breast cancer subtypes is an important clinical task, and automated methods can be used to save time and reduce error. So this project lays a foundation in making the detection of the cancer automated so that more and more people can get it diagonised early so as get cured.

- [**Playstore Apps Success Prediction**](app-success-prediction) [In Progress]

>The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. As there are huge number of apps in the play store and the numbers of the app release every day make it quite competitive for the app developers to get app popular and successful in market. So, in this project we will predict the ratings for apps on the google play store.

## Libraries

- **Numpy** : 
Numpy is Numerical Python library for doing high level math computations involving complex data structures like matrices.

- **Pandas** : 
Pandas is a great library for Data Science. It provides high level abstraction implementation for analysing the data. Click this [link](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) for its documentation.

- **Seaborn and Matplotlib** : 
Matplotlib is a python library used for visualizing the data. It is used for plotting the data for getting the insights from the data and creating statistical interferences. Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib but can do quite amazing things in the area of visualization - matplotlib works more as a “bare bones” visualization tool.

- **Scikit-learn** : 
Scikit-learn provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface in Python.
